### Overview
Helping Hands is a neighborhood-based mutual aid app. It is intended to solve for the lack of strong social safety nets in our communities and connect people in need with others who have surpluses of various essential items (food, school supplies, toiletries etc.). The ultimate goal of the app is to help bring people together in trying times and foster strong, self-supporting local communities.

- Release 2 will hopefully include Google Maps API integration. 
### Technologies
